# Should You Stick with Zonal NAT Gateway or Switch to Regional NAT Gateway (RNAT)?

If your architecture has multiple Private Subnets across different Availability Zones (AZs) that need outbound internet access, you traditionally only had two options — and both came with significant trade-offs:

1. Deploy a single NAT Gateway in one AZ (and point all routes to it):
   - Cross-AZ Data Transfer Costs: You get hit with cross-AZ data transfer fees. The higher your outbound traffic, the bigger your end-of-month bill gets.
   - Loss of High Availability (HA): If the AZ hosting your NAT Gateway goes down, all Private Subnets in other AZs instantly lose internet connectivity.

2. Deploy a dedicated NAT Gateway in every AZ:
   - Solves both the HA and Cross-AZ Data Transfer issues...
   - ... But forces you to pay fixed hourly maintenance rates for at least 2–3 NAT Gateways simultaneously, even if traffic in some AZs is minimal.

### The AWS Turning Point: Regional NAT Gateway (RNAT)

To solve these pain points, AWS introduced Regional NAT Gateway (RNAT), which operates at the VPC level. Here is what you can achieve with RNAT:

1. Key Operational Advantages
- Single NAT Gateway with Built-In HA: No more Single Point of Failure (SPOF) risks, as AWS automatically manages multi-AZ resilience under the hood.
- Simplified Routing: You only need a single Route Table pointing `0.0.0.0/0` to RNAT for the entire VPC, eliminating the need to manage complex, per-AZ Route Tables.
- No More Multi-AZ Routing Complexity: Managing AZ-specific network paths is no longer a headache.

 2. Logically Regional, Physically Distributed
While RNAT is logically a regional resource, its physical underlying infrastructure is distributed across multiple AZs. Thanks to this architecture, AWS automatically handles three tasks that DevOps teams previously had to manage manually:
- Automatic Failure Detection: Instantly detects if an underlying infrastructure node or AZ encounters an issue.
- Automatic Traffic Rerouting: Immediately redirects traffic to healthy infrastructure without dropping connections.
- Auto-Scaling Based on Demand: Dynamically scales processing capacity up or down depending on your workload's real-time outbound traffic.

 3. Immediate Cost Savings
- Fewer NAT Gateways to Manage: Reduces the total number of NAT Gateways, directly cutting down hourly maintenance charges.
- Eliminating Cross-AZ Data Processing Fees: No more hidden end-of-month surprises under the "Cross-AZ Data Transfer" line item.
- Transparent & Predictable Billing: Traffic is billed where it flows, eliminating complex cross-AZ cost overlaps.
